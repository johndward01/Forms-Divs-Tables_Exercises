        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
            high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
            attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect
            existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore
            reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
            modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source
            or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python supports multiple assignments in one statement
                Python will let you assign the same value to multiple variables in one statement. It will also let you
                assign values to multiple variables at once.
                <br>
                <br>
                This also means swapping in Python is quicker and can be done in only 1 line of code:
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> a, b = 7, 8
                    >>> a, b = b, a
                    >>> print(a,b)
                    8 7
                </code>
            </pre>
            <li>
                With slicing, it’s easier to reverse a list
                If we slice a list of values from starting to end but with a step of -1, we get the list right to left
                (reversed).
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
                    >>> nums = [::-1]
                    [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
                </code>
            </pre>
            <li>
                To know all the functions in a module we can assign the functions list to a variable, and then print the
                variable.
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> import math
                    >>> dir(math)

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
            functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
            environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
            prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
            and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. - Mozilla</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In JavaScript, null is an object. However, null is not considered an "instance" of an object...
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        alert(typeof null); //alerts 'object'
                        alert(null instanceof Object); //evaluates false
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                NaN stands for "Not a Number", counter-intuitively however, comparing NaN to itself evaluates to
                "false". n fact NaN is not equal to anything. The only way to confirm that something is NaN is via the
                function isNaN().
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        alert(typeof NaN); //alerts 'Number'
                        alert(NaN === NaN); //evaluates false
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                In JavaScript, values are either "truthy" or "falsy". False, zero, null, undefined, empty strings and
                NaN are all "falsy". The rest are "truthy".
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    alert(new Array() == false); //evaluates true
                    var someVar = 0;
                    alert(someVar == false); //evaluates true
                </code>

        <h1>C#</h1>
        <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables
            developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# has its
            roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript
            programmers.</p>

                Enums can have extension methods
                Extension methods provide a way to write methods for existing classes that other people on your team
                might discover and use. Given that enums are classes like any other, it shouldn’t be too surprising that
                you can extend them, like:
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    enum Duration { Day, Week, Month };

                    static class DurationExtensions 
                    {
                        public static DateTime From(this Duration duration, DateTime dateTime)
                        {
                            switch(duration) 
                            {
                                case Day:   return dateTime.AddDays(1);
                                case Week:  return dateTime.AddDays(7);
                                case Month: return dateTime.AddMonths(1);
                                default:    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("duration");
                            }
                        }
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <li>
                Order of static variable declaration in your source code matters
                Some people insist that variables be ordered alphabetically,
                and there are tools around that can reorder for you. However,
                there is one scenario where reordering can break your app.
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    static class Program 
                    {
                        private static int a = 5;
                        private static int b = a;
                      
                        static void Main(string[] args) 
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine(b);
                        }
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This prints the value 5. Reorder the a and b declarations, and it prints 0.</p>
            <li>
                Private instance variables of a class can be accessed by other instances. It’s easy to think of private
                as meaning only this instance of a class can access them. The reality is it means only this class can
                access it - including other instances of this class. It’s quite useful when writing some comparison
                methods.
            </li>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    class KeepSecret 
                    {
                        private int someSecret;

                        public bool Equals(KeepSecret other) 
                        {
                          return other.someSecret == someSecret;
                        }
                    }
